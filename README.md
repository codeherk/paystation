# Paystation for CIS 3296 - Software Design
## Lab 3 
### Group Members
Byron Jenkins & Daniel Dubovoy

### Responsibilities
* Accept payment 
* Calculate parking time based on payment 
* Know earning, parking time bought
* Issue receipts
* Handle buy and cancel events

## Lab 4 
### Group Members
Byron Jenkins, Cynthia Wambua, Sean McNamara, Terrell Nowlin

### Responsibilities
Now that we have the Java class source code to implement the PayStation application. Each class has been tested using JUnit testing tool. Now it is about time to put all the pieces together to complete a final product. In this lab assignment, the goal is to develop a main program to show demos to the clients how the product works.


The simulation software should show the following features:

* accept coins for payment
* 5, 10, 25 cents
* show time bought on display
* when buying a parting ticket, print parking time receipts
* when cancel option is selected, print total returned coin values and number of each coin type
* **implement three rate strategies for three clients: Linear rate for Alphatown, progressive rate for Betatown and alternating rate for Gammatown. Rate strategy selection and change can be done on the fly, i.e. in run-time. The default rate strategy is linear rate.**

### Diagram
Using [StarUML](http://staruml.io/), I designed an UML Diagram that shows the relationships between classes and interfaces of this project.
